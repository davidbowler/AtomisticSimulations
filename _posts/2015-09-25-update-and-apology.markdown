I have not blogged since January; in part, this is down to the pressures of
other commitments, especially teaching, but also because I was planning to move
this blog (and all my other web-based activities) to GitHub, and I didn't want
to update while moving.  While it took me much longer than I'd hoped, I
am very happy with the end result.

So: this blog post is an apology for my silence and a promise that more regular
blogging will resume.  In particular, I intend to blog, roughly, the teaching
sessions that I am giving my M.Sci. students this year in using DFT and
computational modelling (made easier by the simple integration of MathJax with
GitHub Pages).  This should complement the book - and I welcome comments and
suggestions (easiest by Twitter or email).
